# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-10)

**Core value:** A host app can call `obc.castIntent(intent, cb)` once and get a fully orchestrated file-picker / file-save flow — capability discovery, user selection, sandboxed iframe lifecycle, and PostMessage round-trip — with zero framework lock-in.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — core-implementation

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (core-implementation) — COMPLETE
Plan: 5 of 5

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundations | 1 | 6 min | 6 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6 min)
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 02-core-implementation P02 | 8 | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 02-core-implementation P04 | 4 | 3 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 02-core-implementation P03 | 6 | 4 tasks | 9 files |
| Phase 02-core-implementation P01 | 11 | 4 tasks | 9 files |
| Phase 02-core-implementation P05 | 5 | 1 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Coarse granularity → 4 phases; Phases 2 layers are built in parallel (parallelization: true)
- Roadmap: WS live updates (WS-01..07) included in Phase 2 alongside core layers (not deferred), as all requirements are v1
- Roadmap: Same-origin capability guard (IFR-08) lives in Phase 2 iframe layer; ORCH-01 constructor validation is Phase 3
- Research: Penpal v7 API is `connect({ messenger: new WindowMessenger(...), methods })` — v6 `connectToChild` must not be used anywhere
- Research: tsdown (not tsup) for all build output; tsup is deprecated
- 01-01: Exports map reconciled to actual tsdown 0.21.7 filenames (index.js/index.cjs); research template used obc.esm.js naming not produced by tsdown
- 01-01: biome.json rewritten to Biome 2.4.11 actual API (organizeImports → assist.actions.source; noVar removed; files.includes for ignores)
- 01-01: OBCError.cause declared as plain property (not override) — ES2020 lib lacks Error.cause
- 01-01: tsdown external deprecated → use deps.neverBundle for penpal externalization
- [Phase 02-core-implementation]: 02-02: bridge-adapter.ts already committed by Plan 02-04 when session.ts was written — real import type used, no placeholder needed
- [Phase 02-core-implementation]: 02-02: Biome quoteStyle enforces single quotes (not double) — plan docs were inaccurate, Biome config takes precedence
- [Phase 02-core-implementation]: WindowMessenger vi.mock must use regular function not arrow — arrow functions cannot be constructors in Vitest 4
- [Phase 02-core-implementation]: penpal imported only from src/messaging/penpal-bridge.ts — grep-enforceable single import site
- [Phase 02-core-implementation]: 02-03: setAttribute('style') used for iframe to preserve CSS min() values (happy-dom normalizes them away in style.cssText)
- [Phase 02-core-implementation]: 02-03: root.activeElement used throughout focus-trap — document.activeElement returns shadow host, not inner focused element
- [Phase 02-01]: Biome config uses single quotes (not double as documented in critical rules); template literals and ** exponentiation also enforced
- [Phase 02-01]: FakeWebSocket static constants defined in test to avoid Node env missing global WebSocket; simulateClose uses Event not CloseEvent
- [Phase 02-01]: WS-05 destroyed guard in 3 locations: start(), top of connect(), and top of setTimeout callback
- [Phase 02-core-implementation]: Biome organizeImports reorders exports alphabetically within sections; comments separate logical layer groups

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 2] Shadow DOM + iframe focus delegation has browser-specific quirks; spike needed before implementing UI layer focus trap
- [Pre-Phase 2] Penpal v7 MessagePort behavior under specific CSP configs is under-documented; validate handshake timing in test fixtures early
